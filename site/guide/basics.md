# Basic Usage

This section will teach you the fundamentals of PopClip: how to get the PopClip bar to appear and disappear, and a tour of the built-in actions.

## **How does PopClip work?**

PopClip runs in the background and waits for you to select text in another app. PopClip will appear automatically when you select text with your mouse, and can also be made to appear by pressing a [keyboard shortcut]().

When PopClip appears, it will show a menu of actions that you can perform on the selected text. It is context-sensitive, meaning that the actions that appear are dependent on the text you select. For example, actions that operate on URLs will only appear when the text you select contains a URL.

PopClip works in most apps but there are some [apps that PopClip is not compatible with]().
