# Adding Extensions

Extensions add new actions to PopClip. You can install ready-made extensions and also create your own. 

Configure, re-order and remove extensions in the [Actions pane](./settings#action-settings).

:::tip Get stuck in!
Browse the [PopClip Extensions Directory](/extensions/) which currently contains <DirectoryCount /> extensions.

## Installing a downloadable extension

When you download a ready-made extension it will have the file extension `.popclipextz` or `.popcliptxt`. Simply open the file to add the extension to PopClip.

### Unsigned Extensions

If you see an "Unsigned Extension" warning it means the extension is not from PopClip's developer. You will need to confirm whether you want to install the extension.

:::warning
Beware of extensions from untrusted sources as they can potentially be malicious.

## Installing a snippet

PopClip can load extensions directly from a special plain text format called a "snippet". Snippets are useful for creating quick extensions and sharing them as plain text, without having to create a file. Snippets can be shared in emails, forums, on websites â€” anywhere you put plain text.

Here is an example snippet, which defines an action for searching Emojipedia for the selected text:

```
#popclip
name: Emojipedia
icon: search filled E
url: https://emojipedia.org/search/?q=***
```

To install that, you select the text and then click the action *Install Extension "Emojipedia"* that appears in the PopClip bar.

:::tip About Snippets
Notice that the first line of the snippet starts with `#popclip`. This is a special marker that tells PopClip that this is a snippet. For more about snippets, see [TODO](#) in the developer reference.

## Creating your own extension

For more about creating both snippets and downloadable extensions, see [Extensions Developer Reference](/dev/).
