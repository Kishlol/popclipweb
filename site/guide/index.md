# What is PopClip?

PopClip is a Mac utility tool that pops up with a menu of actions when you select text on your screen.

Actions range from simple copy and paste to more complex tasks such as translating text. Using [extensions](/guide/extensions), you can add actions to PopClip to adapt it your needs. Extensions can connect to various apps and services directly, allowing you to perform actions such as sending text to a note-taking app or searching for text on a search engine.

Think of PopClip as a context-aware assistant that provides you with tools you can use instantly, without having to switch between apps or windows.

PopClip is available for macOS only. It is a [paid](/buy) app with a [free trial](/download). It has been in continuous development since 2011.

## Frequently asked questions

*See also [Troubleshooting](/kb/troubleshooting) if you have questions about technical issues.*

* **Is there / will you make a version of PopClip for iPhone or iPad?**
  Unfortunately PopClip would not be possible on iOS, due to the way iOS apps work.

* **Is there / will you make a version of PopClip for Windows?**
  I don't make a Windows version of PopClip and I have no plans to do so. There is a similar app for Windows called [SnipDo](https://snipdo-app.com/) (formerly Pantherbar), which the developer says was was inspired by PopClip. However, I have no involvement with that app at all.

* **Can you make the Dictionary action use the macOS pop-up dictionary instead of the Dictionary app?**
  I'd love it to do this, but it is technically not possible (as far as I know).

## Languages and translation

PopClip's user interface is developed in English and is translated into Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Turkish. These translations have been produced by a mix of paid translation services and volunteer users.

Users can contribute translations in their own language using the CrowdIn platform. If you would like to add or suggest changes to translations please go to: [Pilotmoon Apps project on CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/pilotmoon-apps). If your language does not exist in the project, send me an email so I can add it.

The documentation only available in English.

## About the developer

PopClip is not made by a large company or even a small team; it's made by one person. Nick Moore. I'm also the one writing this user guide. I'm from the UK and my native language is English. To get in touch, see [Support and Feedback](/support).

[Pilotmoon Software](https://pilotmoon.com/) is the business name under which I have published my apps. You will see some links and references to `pilotmoon.com` in various places, and I use the `@pilotmoon` handle on GitHub and elsewhere.
