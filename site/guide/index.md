# Introduction

## What is PopClip?

![PopClip screenshot](./shot-general-4.png "Screenshot of PopClip")

**PopClip is a Mac utility tool that pops up with a menu of actions when you select text on your screen.**

Actions range from simple copy and paste to more complex tasks such as translating text. Using [extensions](/extensions/), you can add actions to PopClip to adapt it your needs. Extensions can connect to various apps and services directly, allowing you to perform actions such as sending text to a note-taking app or searching for text on a search engine.

Think of PopClip as a context-aware assistant that provides you with tools you can use instantly, without having to switch between apps or windows.

PopClip is a [paid](/buy) app, with a [free trial](/download) available. It has been in continuous development since 2011.

## About this app

### About the developer

PopClip is not made by a large company or even a small team; it's made by one person. [Pilotmoon Software](https://pilotmoon.com/about/) is a name I use for my business but it's just me, a solo developer, Nick Moore. I'm also the one writing this user guide. I had the idea for PopClip in 2011 and I've been working on it ever since. I'm from the UK and my native language is English.

### Languages

PopClip's user interface is available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Slovak, Spanish, Traditional Chinese and Turkish. The language is automatically selected based on your Mac's language settings.
