# What is PopClip?

PopClip is a Mac utility tool that pops up with a menu of actions when you select text on your screen.

Actions range from simple copy and paste to more complex tasks such as translating text. Using [extensions](/guide/extensions), you can add actions to PopClip to adapt it your needs. Extensions can connect to various apps and services directly, allowing you to perform actions such as sending text to a note-taking app or searching for text on a search engine.

Think of PopClip as a context-aware assistant that provides you with tools you can use instantly, without having to switch between apps or windows.

PopClip is a [paid](/buy) app with a [free trial](/download) available. It is available for macOS only.

## About PopClip

### About the developer

PopClip is not made by a large company or even a small team; it's made by one person. [Pilotmoon Software](https://pilotmoon.com/about/) is a name I use for my business but it's just me, a solo developer, Nick Moore. I'm also the one writing this user guide. I had the idea for PopClip in 2011 and I've been working on it ever since. I'm from the UK and my native language is English. For contact details, see [Support and Feedback](/support).

### Languages

PopClip's user interface is available English, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, and Turkish.

The documentation only available in English.
