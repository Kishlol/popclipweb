# What is PopClip?

PopClip is a Mac utility tool that pops up with a menu of actions when you select text on your screen.

Actions range from simple copy and paste to more complex tasks such as translating text. Using [extensions](/guide/extensions), you can add actions to PopClip to adapt it your needs. Extensions can connect to various apps and services directly, allowing you to perform actions such as sending text to a note-taking app or searching for text on a search engine.

Think of PopClip as a context-aware assistant that provides you with tools you can use instantly, without having to switch between apps or windows.

PopClip is available for macOS only. It is a [paid](/buy) app with a [free trial](/download). It has been in continuous development since 2011.

## Frequently Asked Questions

*See also [Troubleshooting](/kb/troubleshooting) if you have questions about technical issues.*

* **Is there / will you make a version of PopClip for iPhone or iPad?**
  Unfortunately PopClip would not be possible on iOS, due to the way iOS apps work.

* **Is there / will you make a version of PopClip for Windows?**
  I don't make a Windows version of PopClip and I have no plans to do so. There is a similar app for Windows called [SnipDo](https://snipdo-app.com/) (formerly Pantherbar), which the developer says was was inspired by PopClip. However, I have no involvement with that app at all.

* **Can you make the Dictionary action use the macOS pop-up dictionary instead of the Dictionary app?**
  I'd love it to do this, but it is technically not possible (as far as I know).

## About the developer

PopClip is not made by a large company or even a small team; it's made by one person. Nick Moore. I'm also the one writing this user guide. I'm from the UK and my native language is English. To get in touch, see [Support and Feedback](/support).

[Pilotmoon Software](https://pilotmoon.com/) is the business name under which I have published my apps. You will see some links and references to `pilotmoon.com` in various places, and I use the `@pilotmoon` handle on GitHub and elsewhere.
