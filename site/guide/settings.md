# Settings

This page will give you a comprehensive overview of PopClip's settings.

## The settings menu

PopClip's settings menu is accessed by clicking the ![PopClip menu bar icon](./icon-status.png#icon) icon in the menu bar.

![](./shot-settings-general-2.png "PopClip menu bar icon and settings menu.")

The settings menu has five panes:<br>[![Home icon](./icon-home.png#icon) Home](#home-pane), [![Options icon](./icon-options.png#icon) Options](#options-pane), [![Actions icon](./icon-exts.png#icon) Actions](#actions-pane), [![Excluded Apps icon](./icon-apps.png#icon) Excluded Apps](#excluded-apps-pane) and [![About icon](./icon-about.png#icon) About](#about-pane).

### Turn PopClip On and Off

The large button at the top showing **ON** and **OFF** controls whether PopClip appears automatically when you select text.

As a short-cut, you can also toggle PopClip on and off by secondary clicking (Right-click or Control-click) the PopClip icon in the menu bar.

On/off state can also be set with [AppleScript](/).

:::tip Still works when off!
Even when PopClip is turned off, you can use the [keyboard shortcut](./basics#activate-with-a-keyboard-shortcut) to make PopClip appear.

### Keyboard Shortcut

Set a keyboard shortcut for making PopClip appear. See [Activate with a keyboard shortcut](./basics#activate-with-a-keyboard-shortcut) for details on using it.

- To set the keyboard shortcut, click the Record Shortcut button and then press the keys you want to use. The key combination must include at least one of the modifer keys ⌃, ⌥, and ⌘.

- To remove or change the keyboard shortcut, click the button and then press the new keys or click the 'X' button.

:::tip Choosing a keyboard shortcut
You can use any key combination you like, but it's good to pick somehting that's easy to remember and doesn't conflict with other common shortcuts. Personally, I use ⌃⌘P.
