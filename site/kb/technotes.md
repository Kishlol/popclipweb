## Version numbering

Production releases of PopClip have a version number in the form `year.month`, e.g. `2023.7`, corresponding to when the version was released. In case of multiple releases in the same month, a third number is added, e.g. `2023.7.1`.

Beta versions have versions such as `Build 4151` which are not related to the release date.

The number in parentheses after the version number is the build number which is consistent across all editions and release channels except that the Mac App Store edition build number is always 1000000 higher than the other editions. For example, `2023.7 (4151) Standalone Edition` is the same version as `2023.7 (1004151) Mac App Store Edition`.
