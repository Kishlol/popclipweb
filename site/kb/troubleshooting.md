## Solutions to common problems

| Problem                                                          | Possible Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Not all of the enabled actions are appearing in the PopClip bar. | This is normal, because actions only appear when they are applicable. See: [Why are some actions not appearing?](#why-are-some-actions-not-appearing)                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| PopClip bar appears, but actions are not working properly.       | This is a common problem just after upgrading macOS. Solution: [Remove and re-add Accessibility permission](#remove-and-re-add-accessibility-permission).                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Problem using PopClip in a specific app.                         | Check the [App compatibility](#app-compatibility) section to see if there is a known problem with that specific app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|                                                                  | Check whether you have excluded the app from PopClip. See: [Excluded Apps pane](/guide/settings#excluded-apps-pane).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| PopClip bar doesn't appear when selecting text, in any app.      | Check that PopClip is turned on. See: [Turn PopClip On and Off](/guide/settings#turn-popclip-on-and-off).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                                                                  | Check that PopClip has Accessibility permission. See: [Grant Accessibility permission](/guide/install#granting-accessibility-permission).                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|                                                                  | Check whether you can still trigger PopClip using its keyboard shortcut. See: [Activate with a keyboard shortcut](/guide/basics#activate-with-a-keyboard-shortcut).                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                                                  | Check whether you have customized your mouse pointer using an app like [MouseScape](https://github.com/alexzielenski/Mousecape) or [Cursor Pro](https://www.ixeau.com/cursor-pro/). PopClip cannot appear automatically if you have a custom mouse pointer.                                                                                                          |

PopClip can only appear automatically if your systemwide keyboard shortcuts are the standard ⌘X, ⌘C and ⌘V.                                                                                                                                                                            |

|                                                                  | Try rebooting your Mac.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| PopClip bar appears then immediately disappears.                 | Check whether you are running both the Setapp and Standalone or Mac App Store editions at the same time. Only one edition should be installed at a time.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|                                                                  | Check whether you are using the 3rd party macOS extension "Add to Fantastical" which comes with [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical). This is in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Extensions → Installed extensions. PopClip may behave unreliably if this is enabled.                                                                             |
| PopClip bar disappearing too quickly.                            | PopClip does not disappear on a timer, but only when you move the mouse away, click, scroll, or begin to type. (See: [Make popclip disappear](/guide/basics#make-popclip-disappear).) Keep the mouse near the PopClip bar to prevent it disappearing.                                                                                                                |
| A specific extension is not working.                             | Try downloading the latest version of the extension. (Note that extensions do not autmatically update.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| PopClip app launches but no user interface appears.              | You may be using [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/), [Vanilla](https://matthewpalmer.net/vanilla/) or a similar app. Disable it or configure it not to hide PopClip.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| PopClip has locked up / using 100% CPU.                          | Force Quit PopClip using Activity Monitor. If this happens repeatedly, please report it and any steps that cause the lock-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| A "click" or "purr" sound when selecting text.                   | Check whether you are using either [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) or [LaunchBar](https://obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html), and have the clipboard merging feature enabled. The way PopClip works is triggering this feature, so you will need to disable it. The checkbox is "Fast append selected text" in Alfred and "Enable ClipMerge" in LaunchBar. |

## Further information

### Why are some actions not appearing?

![](media/shot-missing-actions-1.png#bar "Only Search and Copy are appearing! Is there something wrong?")

It is normal for only some of the enabled actions to appear in the PopClip bar.
This is because PopClip only shows those actions that are applicable to the
current text selection and context. For example:

- The Cut and Paste actions will only appear if you have invoked PopClip in a
  place where text can be cut or pasted. So they won't appear when selecting
  normal text on a webpage, for example. But they would appear when writing text
  in an app like Mail or TextEdit.

- The Open Link action will only appear if you have selected a URL, for example:
  `https://apple.com/mac/`.

- The Dictionary action will only appear if you have selected a dictionary word.

- The Reveal in Finder action will only appear if you have selected a file or
  folder path that exists locally, for example: `~/Documents/`.

- The Spelling action will only appear if you have selected editable text that
  is misspelled and for which there are suggestions available in at least one of
  the enabled languages.

- Actions added by extensions have similar conditions that determine whether
  they appear, on a per-action basis.

If, given the above explanation, you are still sure that an action is failing to
appear when it should, please [let me know](/support). Be specific about action
that isn't appearing, the app you are selecting text in, and the exact text you
have selected.

### Remove and re-add Accessibility permission

The following procedure can help if PopClip is not working properly. It removes
PopClip from the Accessibility permission list and then adds it again. It is
most likely to be required after upgrading macOS from one version ot another.

1. Quit PopClip

2. Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility

3. In the list, highlight PopClip and then remove it using the "–" (minus)
   button. (Fully remove it, don't just uncheck it.)

4. Use the "+" (plus) button add PopClip again to the list.
