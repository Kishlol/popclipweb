# Terms of License

## Definitions

*I*, *me*: Nicholas Moore, a sole trader in the United Kingdom doing business using the the trading name [Pilotmoon Software](https://pilotmoon.com/about).

*You*: a customer who has bought a license for a product.

*Product*: The PopClip software application. The scope of the product does not include any extensions or other software I make available as free downloadable add-ons (see [Extensions](#extensions) below).

*App Store*: Apple's Mac App Store.

*Reseller*: a business with whom I have an arrangement to sell licenses to end customers on my behalf (see Appendix A).

## Free trial

Where a product has a free trial mode, I grant you the right to use the product free of charge for the period of the trial. The trial mode may include purchase reminders and limitations on usage.

I encourage you to make use of the free trial before buying, to see if the product is suitable for your needs.

## App Store purchases

Products you buy through the App Store are delivered to you by Apple using the App Store's installation mechanism.

App Store purchases are subject to Apple's [standard End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/).

::: info
The Apple standard EULA entitles you to install and use the product on any Mac that you own or control.

## License key purchases

When you buy a license key, your payment is made to a reseller. License key purchases are subject to the following license agreement and terms.

### License agreement

In consideration of the purchase fee paid by you to the reseller, I grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free right and license to use the product, subject to these terms and the reseller's terms.

### License keys

You will receive a license key as part of the order process, along with instructions on how to use it to activate the product. Activating the product removes all trial restrictions and purchase reminders.

The license key is unique to you and may only be used by you and, for a multi user license, any legitimate additional users. License keys have the following restrictions:

* Single user license: A single user license is purchased when you specify a quantity of 1 at the checkout. You may use it activate the product on any number of machines, for your own personal use only.

* Multi user license: A multi user license is purchased when you specify a quantity of 2 or more at the checkout. You may use it to activate the product on any number of machines, for use by no more than the specified number of people simulaneously.

::: info
 A multi user license is appropriate for a business who wants to buy a product for use by several employees. Please specify the number of users in the quantity field at checkout. You will receive a single license key to be shared between the licensed users.
:::

If you share, publish or otherwise allow use of your license key beyond that granted by the license, your license will be revoked and you may no longer use the product. In such a case, I may use technical means to disable the use the license key.

## Update policy

Your App Store or license key purchase entitles you to lifetime use of the version of the product that was available at the time of purchase. I may, at my sole discretion, provide updated versions of products in future, either as free updates (downloadable from the App Store and/or activatable using your existing license key), or as paid updates requiring a further purchase or subscription.

## Transfer policy

App Store and license key purchases are separate license agreements and are not transferable between each other. Purchasing on the App Store does not entitle you to receive a license key for the same product. If you wish, you may buy a license key separately, in addition to your App Store purchase.

::: info
I am currently offering a 50% discount on license key purchase to existing App Store customers of the same product. Please email proof of your App Store purchase to <a href="mailto:support@pilotmoon.com">support@pilotmoon.com</a> and I will send you a coupon code.
:::

## Refund policy

### Refunds of App Store purchases

App Store purchases are subject to Apple's refund policies. If you want a refund for your purchase from the App Store, please contact [Apple support](https://getsupport.apple.com/).

### Refunds of license key purchases

For license key purchases, you may request a refund from from me for 30 days from the date of purchase. You do not need to provide a reason. To request a refund, email me at <support@pilotmoon.com>, stating your purchase order number and the email address you used for the purchase. I will ask the reseller to send back the money in full. After you receive the refund, your license will be revoked and you may no longer use the product.

You may also have the right to request a refund directly from the reseller, according to the reseller's terms and conditions.

::: info
I make a loss on all refunds due to transaction fees. Therefore, I ask that you make use of the free trial before buying, and only ask for a refund in exceptional circumstances.

## Subscriptions

### Setapp

In consideration of the subscription fees paid by you to Setapp, I grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable (subject to your continued payment of the subscription fees when due and payable), royalty-free right and licence to use the product subject to these terms and Setappâ€™s Terms and Conditions.

## Extensions

I (and others) may publish downloadable add-on extensions that add functionality to the product. For the purposes of these terms, extensions are separate software applications, and are not part of the product. Extensions are subject to their own license terms (see the extension documentation for details).

## Changes to these terms

I may update these terms from time to time, and I will publish the latest version here on the website. The terms published at the time of purchase will apply to that purchase.
